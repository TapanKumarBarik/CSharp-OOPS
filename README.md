# Object-Oriented programming (C#)

C# provides full support for object-oriented programming including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
## Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding the unnecessary details from type consumers.
## Encapsulation
Encapsulation means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
## Inheritance
Inheritance describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class.
## Polymorphism
Polymorphism means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
